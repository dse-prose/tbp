                <h1>DSE mockup</h1>
                <p>The following sections present a custom solution for the development of a digital scholarly edition, based on the specific characteristics of the case study outlined in the <a href="note.html" target="_blank">Note</a> and the encoding strategies discussed in the <a href="tei_enc.html" target="_blank">XML/TEI encoding section</a>. First of all, from a technical perspective, a custom solution is required due to the use of the double endpoint attachment method for encoding textual variants, which necessitates specific handling in the transformation process. As for editorial goals, the primary aim is to enable comparison between the first printed edition of Bembo’s treatise, the earlier version documented by manuscript Vat.lat. 3210 (<b>V</b>), and the subsequent printed editions (<b>M</b> and <b>T</b>). In line with the principles of the printed critical edition (<a href="note.html#ecdotic-principles" target="_blank">Note</a>, <a href="biblio.html#V-2001" target="_blank">Bembo 2001</a>), the internal elaboration of the manuscript text is also taken into account. 
                <p>To this end, the edition will offer <b>multiple textual reconstructions</b> derived from the TEI-encoded source file. For the manuscript witness, three separate outputs are envisioned: <b>base draft</b>, <b>final text</b>, and <b>revision</b>, which documents the sequence of authorial interventions. <b>Each printed witness</b> will likewise be transformed into a separate document.
                <p>The interface design is intended to reflect the authorial process, distinguishing the phase leading from the manuscript to the <i>editio princeps</i> from that which continues from the <i>princeps</i> to the final edition. The core functionality, referred to as the <b>parallel view</b>, aims to facilitate comparison between the text of P and that of the other witnesses, while also documenting the elaborative process related to the manuscript and the variants at the level of each individual witness. A complementary <b>single view</b> mode allows for a focused reading of each witness, accompanied by facsimile images where available.
                <br/>In addition, the proposal includes general functionalities related to other content elements included in the encoding model, such as <b>quotations</b>, <b>linguistic annotations</b>, and <b>other metadata</b>.</p>
                
                <h2 id="parallel-view">Parallel view</h2>
                <p>As explained in the <a href="note.html" target="_blank">Note</a>, two moments can be identified in the history of Bembo’s <i>Prose</i> and the <i>princeps</i> can be considered as a link between them. The compositional process has been reflected in the interface, which enables the comparison between the text of the <b><i>princeps</i></b> and, alternatively, the one of the <b>manuscript</b> witness and of subsequent <b>printed editions</b>.</p>

                <p>In the parallel view, the text is presented in scroll-down mode, with page numbers embedded in the text. Segments involved in <span class="var-bg-style">variants</span> are highlighted with the same background color. In order to avoid clutter, it would be a choice of the user to highlight <span class="para-font-style">paragraphemic variants</span> via the button on the footer of the page.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The printed critical edition chosen as starting point for the development of the project (see <a href="biblio.html#V-2001" target="_blank">Bembo 2001</a>) records the elaboration within the manuscript as well as the variant readings between the text documented by Vat.lat 3210 and the text documented by the <i>princeps</i>. In order to represent the diachrony of interventions within the manuscript, the mockup proposes three different reconstructions: <b>base draft</b>, with related immediate variants, <b>final text</b>, which presents the text resulting from the application of authorial corrections, finally, <b>revision</b>, which shows the corrections documented by the manuscript and referred to different layers of stratification. </p>

                <p>The various typologies of <b>variants within the manuscript</b> are graphically represented as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deletions are represented with a <span class="strikethrough">strikethrough</span></li>
                    <li>Additions are represented as <span class="addition">superscript</span> text</li>
                    <li><b></b>Deletions and additions which can be explained as part of the same intervention are represented as <span class="strikethrough">deletion</span><span class="addition">addition</span></li>
                    <li>When it was possible to distinguish more phases within an elaborated passage, the reconstructed texts are represented one after the other, preceded by a number which specifies the correct sequence</li>
                    <li><span class="elaboration-font-style">Elaborated passages</span> can be identified by a blue color font. Differences in <b>ink</b> and <b>ductus</b> have been recording in the encoding as explained in the <a href="tei_enc.html#ink-encoding">dedicated section</a>, and could eventually be displayed as popup information.</li>
                    <li>Based on the selected chapters, in case of <b>transpositions</b> within V, the variants occur between the <b>base draft</b> and the text in its <b>subsequent elaboration</b> and, also, between the <b>base draft</b> of the manuscript and the <b>text of P</b>. The latter case is thoroughly explained in the <a href="#transpo-across">following paragraph</a>, devoted to the representation of variants across witnesses, while <span class="transpo-font-style">transpositions</span> within the witness are addressed as follows: the base draft shows the text in its original location, while the revision shows it in its new location, which is treated as a link connected to the original location of the text, now replaced by a placeholder.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Finally, <span class="error-font-style">errors</span> listed in the <i>Errata corrige</i> of each edition can be identified by a bright red font color.</p>
                <p>The following images show a visual example for each of the cases discussed above and a legend that summarizes the chromatic and typographic markers proposed.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The reason for this macro-division between base draft, revision and final text is both due to the prosaic nature of the text and the correction typologies documented by the history of <i>Prose</i>, which, especially from the <i>princeps</i> onward, are mostly additions and transpositions. An edition which analytically reconstructs the correctional phases identifiable in the elaboration of the text could be hard to interpret for a case study such as the one at hand, whereas <b>chronological encoding</b>and <b>phase visualization</b>, if limited to the moments of base draft, final version and revision, including the representation of the eventual internal stratification in the latter, seem more immediate and readable, without excluding the representation of the diachrony of the text, and also appear to be sound with the ecdotic principles of the printed edition.</p>
                <p>As for <b>variants across witnesses</b>, the following cases have been addressed:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="omission-bg-style">Omissions</span> are identified by a red background color</li>
                    <li><span class="addition-bg-style">Additions</span> are identified by a green background color</li>
                    <li id="transpo-across"><span class="transpo-bg-style">Transpositions</span> share a purple background color. If there is a one-to-one correspondence between the original passage and the transposed one, transpositions would be treated as links from P to the target. In cases where a single original passage corresponds to multiple transposed passages across different witnesses, a possible solution could be to display a tooltip containing the actual links to each transposed passage.</li>
                </ul>
                <div id="fig-container-7">
                <figure class="prototype-figure" id="transp-img-1">
                    <img src="images/transpo_base_p.png"/>
                    <figcaption>Parallel view. Transposition between text of V's base draft and text of the <i>princeps</i></figcaption>

                </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Finally, the model takes into account <span class="spc-font-style">stop-press corrections</span> in the third edition. These are written in bold and underlined. By clicking on the portion of text involved in the correction, a modal would allow to read the text prior to the corrections and, possibly, the copy from which the text is derived.</p>
