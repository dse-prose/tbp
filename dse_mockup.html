                <p>Considering the specific features of the case study and the encoding choices made, the following paragraphs present a proposal for a digital scholarly edition designed to effectively represent the multiple layers of information captured through TEI markup.<br/>The interface is intended to reflect the authorial process, distinguishing the phase leading from the manuscript to the <i>editio princeps</i> from that which continues from the <i>princeps</i> to the final edition. The edition primarily aims to facilitate comparison between the text of P and that of the other witnesses, while also documenting the elaborative process related to the manuscript and the variants at the level of each individual witness. These functionalities, summarized under the label <b>parallel view</b>, are complemented by a <b>single view</b> mode, which, for each witness, allows to switch multiple visualizations (image-to-text and text-to-text) and text presentations.<br/> In addition, the edition includes general functionalities related to other content elements included in the encoding model, such as citations, linguistic annotations, and other metadata.</p>
                <!--Moreover, the printed edition presents an original system of representation of the variants, which can be intuitively translated in an interactive interface, able to represent the different typology of variants through chromatic and typographic elements. -->

                
                <h2 id="parallel-view">Parallel view</h2>
                <p>As explained in the <a href="note.html">Note</a>, two moments can be identified in the history of Bembo’s <i>Prose</i> and the <i>princeps</i> can be considered as a link between them. The composition process has been reflected in the interface: since the corrections documented by V bring towards the text of P, which is the reference for M and then for T, the interface separates the two elaborative moments, allowing the comparison of the text of the manuscript and of the following printed editions with the <i>princeps</i>.</p>

                <p>In the parallel view, the text is presented in scroll-down mode, with page numbers embedded in the text. Segments involved in <span class="var-bg-style">variants</span> are highlighted with the same background color. In order to avoid clutter, it would be a choice of the user to highlight <span class="para-font-style">paragraphemic variants</span> via the button on the footer of the page.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The printed critical edition chosen as starting point for the development of the project records the elaboration within the manuscript as well as the variant readings between the text documented by Vat.lat 3210 and the text documented by the <i>princeps</i>. In order to represent the diachrony of interventions within the manuscript, the mockup proposes three different reconstructions: <b>base draft</b>, with related correctorial accidents and immediate variants, <b>final text</b>, which presents the text resulting from the application of authorial corrections, finally, <b>revision</b>, which shows the corrections documented by the manuscript and referred to different layers of stratification. <!-- A tooltip on hover describes the typology of variant and optionally its collocation on the page. --></p>

                <p>The various typologies of variants referred to the manuscript are graphically represented as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <!-- <li><b>Omitted text</b> is enclosed between minus (-) symbols</li>
                    <li><b>Inserted text</b> is enclosed between plus (+) symbols</li> -->
                    <li>Deletions are represented with a <span class="strikethrough">strikethrough</span></li>
                    <li>Additions are represented as <span class="addition">superscript</span> text</li>
                    <li><b></b>Deletions and additions which can be explained as part of the same intervention are represented as <span class="strikethrough">deletion</span><span class="addition">addition</span></li>
                    <li>When it was possible to distinguish more phases within an elaborated passage, the reconstructed texts are represented one after the other, preceded by a superscript number which specifies the correct sequence</li>
                    <li><span class="elaboration-font-style">Elaborated passages</span> can be identified by a blue color font. When corrections have been written using a <b>different ink</b> or present a different <b>ductus</b>, this is specified in a tooltip.</li>
                    <li>In the case of <b>transpositions</b> within V, the variants occur between the base draft and the text in its following elaboration and, also, between the base draft of the manuscript and the text of P. The latter case is thoroughly explained in the <a href="#transpo-across">following paragraph</a>, devoted to the representation of variants across witnesses, while <span class="transpo-font-style">transpositions</span> within the witness are addressed as follows: the base draft shows the text in its original location, while the revision shows it in its new location, which is treated as a link connected to the original location of the text, now replaced by a placeholder.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Finally, <span class="error-font-style">errors</span> listed in the <i>Errata corrige</i> of each edition can be identified by a bright red font color. The following images show a visual example for each of the cases discussed above and a legend that summarizes the chromatic and typographic markers proposed.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The reason for this macro-division between base draft, revision and final text is both due to the prosaic nature of the text and the correction typologies documented by the history of <i>Prose</i>, which, especially from the <i>princeps</i> onward, are additions and expansions <!--check AU PHIL-->. An edition which analytically reconstructs the correctional phases identifiable in the elaboration of the text, <!-- like in Leopardi's <a href="" target="_blank">Idilli</a> digital edition, --> could be hard to read for a case study such as the one at hand, whereas chronological encoding and phase visualization, if limited to the moments of base draft, final version and revision, including the representation of the eventual internal stratification in the latter, seem more immediate and readable, without excluding the representation of the diachrony of the text, and also appear to be sound with the ecdotic principles of the printed edition.</p>
                <p>As for variants across witnesses, the following cases have been addressed:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="omission-bg-style">Omissions</span> are identified by a red background color</li>
                    <li><span class="addition-bg-style">Additions</span> are identified by a green background color</li>
                    <li id="transpo-across"><span class="transpo-bg-style">Transpositions</span> share a purple background color. If there is a one-to-one correspondence between the original passage and the transposed one, transpositions would be treated as links from P to the target. In cases where a single original passage corresponds to multiple transposed passages across different witnesses, a possible solution could be to display a tooltip containing the actual links to each transposed passage.</li>
                </ul>
                <div id="fig-container-7">
                <figure class="prototype-figure" id="transp-img-1">

                </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Finally, the model takes into account <span class="spc-font-style">stop-press corrections</span> in the third edition. These are written in bold and underlined. By clicking on the portion of text involved in the correction, a modal would allow to read the text prior to the corrections and to indicate the copy from which the text is derived.</p>
