                <p>Considering the specific features of the case study and the encoding choices made, a digital scholarly edition has been envisioned that aims to effectively represent the multiple layers of information captured through TEI markup.<br/> <!-- and could thus be defined a "paradigmatic edition" (<a href="index.html#biblio-sec">Pierazzo 2014</a>, <a href="index.html#biblio-sec">Pierazzo-Driscoll 2020</a>). --> The interface is designed to reflect the authorial process, distinguishing the phase that leads from the manuscript to the <i>editio princeps</i> from that which continues from the <i>princeps</i> to the final edition. The edition primarily aims to enable a comparison between the text of P and that of the other witnesses, while also documenting the elaborative process related to the manuscript and the variants at the level of each individual witness. These functionalities, summarized under the label <b>parallel view</b>, are complemented by a <b>single view</b> mode, which, for each witness, allows switch multiple visualizations (image-to-text and text-to-text) and text presentations.<br/> In addition, the edition includes general functionalities related to other content elements included in the encoding model, such as citations, linguistic annotations, and other metadata.</p>
                <!--Moreover, the printed edition presents an original system of representation of the variants, which can be intuitively translated in an interactive interface, able to represent the different typology of variants through chromatic and typographic elements. -->
                <h2 id="parallel-view">Parallel view</h2>
                <p>As explained in the <a href="note.html">Note</a>, two moments can be identified in the history of Bemboâ€™s <i>Prose</i> and the <i>princeps</i> can be considered as a link between them. The composition process has been reflected in the interface: since the corrections documented by V bring towards the text of P, which is the reference for M and then for T, the interface separates the two elaborative moments, allowing the comparison of the text of the manuscript and of the following printed editions with the <i>princeps</i>.</p>

                <p>The printed critical edition chosen as starting point for the development of the project records, together with the variant readings between the text documented by Vat.lat 3210 and the text documented by the <i>princeps</i>, the elaboration within the manuscript. Thus, V presents an internal stratification, which includes a <b>base draft</b> and a following <b>layer of elaboration></b>, involving variants belonging to different strata. In order to represent the diachrony of interventions, the mockup distinguishes between two macro-phases: <b>base draft</b>, with related correctorial accidents and immediate variants, and <b>revised text</b>, composed by different layers of stratification. A tooltip on hover describes the typology of variant and optionally its collocation on the page. The various typologies of variants are graphically represented as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When corrections have been written using a <b>different ink</b>, this has been represented with a different color of the font. When, on top of the ink, the editor identified differences in the <i>ductus</i>, the font-family has been changed as well</li>
                    <li><b>Omitted text</b> is enclosed between minus (-) symbols</li>
                    <li><b>Inserted text</b> is enclosed between plus (+) symbols</li>
                    <li><b></b>Deletions and additions which can be explained as part of the same intervention are represented as <span class="strikethrough">deletion</span><span class="addition">addition</span></li>
                    <li>When it was possible to distinguish more phases within an elaborated passage, these are represented one after the other, preceded by a superscript number which specifies the correct sequence</li>
                    <li><span class="elaboration-font-style">Elaborated passages</span> can be identified by a blue color font both in the base draft and in the revised text</li>
                    <li>In the case of <b>transpositions</b> within V, the variants occur between the base draft and the text in its following elaboration and, also, between the base draft of the manuscript and the text of P. The latter case is thoroughly explained in the <a href="#transpo-across">following paragraph</a>, devoted to the representation of variants across witnesses, while <span class="transpo-font-style">transpositions</span> within the witness are addressed as follows: the base draft shows the text in its original location, while the revised text shows the segment in its new location, which is treated as a link connected to the original location of the text.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Finally, <span class="error-font-style">errors</span> listed in the <i>Errata corrige</i> of each edition can be identified by a bright red color font. The following images show a visual example for each of the cases discussed above and a legend that summarizes the chromatic and typographic markers proposed.</p>

                <p>The reason for this macro-division between base draft and subsequent elaboration is mainly due to the prosaic nature of the text. An edition which analytically reconstructs the correctional phases identifiable in the elaboration of the text, like in Leopardi Ecdosys, could be cumbersome for an extended text, because it would be difficult for the reader to appreciate the evolution of the authorâ€™s corrections, especially considered that, just in the ten pages selected for the project, three different inks â€“ thus at least three different phases â€“ are present. However, chronological encoding and phase visualization, if limited to the two moments of base draft and subsequent elaboration, including the representation of the eventual internal stratification in the latter, seem more immediate and readable, without excluding the representation of the diachrony of the text, and also appear to be sound with the ecdotic principles of the printed edition.</p>
                <p>On the textual level starting from the typologies identified by the editor of the printed edition, the following cases have been addressed:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="omission-bg-style">Omissions</span> are identified by a red background color</li>
                    <li><span class="addition-bg-style">Additions</span> are identified by a green background color</li>
                    <li id="transpo-across"><span class="transpo-bg-style">Transpositions</span> across witnesses share a purple background color. Transposed segments could be treated as links from P to the target of the transposition in the other witnesses and viceversa</li>
                </ul>
                <div id="fig-container-7">
                <figure class="prototype-figure" id="transp-img-1">
                    <img src="images/transpo_base_p.png"/>
                    <figcaption>Parallel view. Transposition between text of V's base draft and text of the <i>princeps</i></figcaption>

                </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Finally, the model takes into account the presence of <span class="spc-font-style">stop-press corrections</span> in the third edition. These are written in bold and underlined. By clicking on the portion of text involved in the variants, a modal allows to read the text prior to the corrections and indicates the copy from which the text is extracted.</p>
                <figure class="prototype-figure" id="stop-press-img">
                    <img src="images/stop_press.png"/>
                    <figcaption>Parallel view. An example of stop-press correction</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h2 id="single-view">Single view</h2>
                <p>The single view, which can be toggled for each witness, provide the user the possibility to read the text - either in the semidiplomatic or critical edition - next to the facsimiles, so that the transcription can be compared with the primary source, or to choose a text-to-text mode. The semi-diplomatic edition presents the text according to the normalizations specified in the <a>Note</a>, with line breaks preserved and displaying one page at a time. The critical edition, like the parallel view, presents the text in scroll-down mode. The single view doesn't allow for a synoptic view of the witnesses, but bt clicking on variants a popup shows the readings in the other witnesses. Errors listed in the <i>Errata corrige</i> are still identified by a red color font: the difference between the semi-diplomatic edition and the critical edition is that the former displays the text as printed on the page, whereas the latter displays the corrected text.</p>

                <p>The manuscript witness provides, in addition to the semi-diplomatic and critical editions, two further textual representations: the base draft and the final text. The latter, unlike the revised text presented in the parallel view, offers a reconstruction of the text as resulting from the application of the authorial corrections, without attempting to reconstruct their sequence. The text-to-text mode, therefore, allows not only to compare the semi-diplomatic and critical editions, but the base and final version.</p>
