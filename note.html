            <h1>Philological note</h1>
            <p>The following sections present the witnesses chosen for the project and the criteria adopted in the transcription and encoding of the text. The selection from Bembo's <i>Prose</i> has been limited to the first seven chapters of Book Third.</p>
            <h2 id="witnesses-sec">Witnesses</h2>
            <p>The text of Bembo’s <i>Prose</i> before the first printed edition is documented by manuscript Vat.lat. 3210, held in Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana. It is a transcription on which Bembo started working in 1521, and more systematically in 1522-1523, that the author later decided to use as a working copy, as proved by the analysis carried out by Vela, who was able to identify different strata in the elaboration of the text, based both on the manuscript composition and material characteristics (Vela 2001, pp di riferimento).</p>
            <p>The first edition of Bembo’s treatise was published by the venetian editor Giovanni Tacuino in 1525. It is an in-folio edition, characterized by high typographic quality. For the sake of the project, the copy held at Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence, with shelfmark Post.3, available on Internet Archive, was chosen. The book is listed among the copies collated by the editor of the printed edition and, as the copy chosen by Vela as model, it presents errors in the page numbers and the handwritten correction by Cola Bruno on f.41r.</p>
            <p>In 1538, Francesco Marcolini published in Venice the second edition of Bembo’s <i>Prose</i>. The copy used for the project is the available on the FICLIT digital library.</p>
            <p>The editorial history of the third edition, published by Torrentino in Florence in 1549, is particularly complex due to the presence of stop-press corrections which can be ascribed to Benedetto Varchi’s interventions, on both textual and paratextual level  (<a href="biblio.html">Sorella 2001</a>, BCP 2018). As a consequence, we have some copies which, though baring the same material characteristics of T, document a text that is different from the one of T and prior to Varchi’s interventions. Moreover, other copies exist which belong to a different emission with the title-page, wanted by Varchi and subsequently removed as a consequence of a request made by Bembo’s heir, Carlo Gualteruzzi. These witnesses will be referred to throughout the project with the same sigla used in the already mentioned studies by Sorella and Bertolo, Cursi and Pulsoni: Ti for the emission with title-page and Tii for the copies printed before Varchi’s interventions.</p>
            <p>For the sake of the project, the text of T has been collated on the copy held at Biblioteca Statale of Cremona. The studies by Sorella and Bertolo, Cursi and Pulsoni were used as a reference to record stop-press corrections due to Varchi’s intervention and, in order to associate them with the text documented by the previous state, the copy of Tii held by Biblioteca Complutense of Madrid available on Google Books has been used.</p>
            <h2 id="edition-sec">Editorial criteria</h2>
            <p>The text of the <i>princeps</i> has been manually transcribed from the critical edition chosen as starting point for the development of the project (Pietro Bembo, <i>Prose della volgar lingua. L’editio princeps del 1525 riscontrata con l’autografo Vaticano Latino 3210</i>, edizione critica a cura di Claudio Vela, Bologna, CLUEB, 2001). The criteria applied by the editor have been preserved and, where appropriate, applied to the texts of the second and third edition. In particular, in an overall conservative approach to the transcription, the printed edition adopted the following normalizations:
                <ul>
                    <li>u/v and long-s graphemes have been transcribed according to the modern use</li>
                    <li>hyphens have been added to identify synthetic forms in the text that are analytic in the current spelling (e.g. <i>gliantichi</i> transcribed as <i>gli-antichi</i>, <i>cihanno</i> as <i>ci-hanno</i>)</li>
                    <li>abbreviations of the names of the authors quoted by Bembo (e.g. "Bocc." for "Boccaccio") were expanded (whereas recurring solutions, such as "M." for "Messer", have been preserved)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The normalizations above where extended to the texts of M (Marcolini 1538) and T (Torrentino 1549) where appropriate. The latter edition presented some additional graphic characteristics that were addressed as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Ampersands (&), not used in V, P and M but frequently adopted in T, have been transcribed as <i>et</i></li>
                    <li>Abbreviations of "n", typical of T, have been expanded (e.g. <i>finiēti</i> was transcribed as <i>finienti</i>)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>As thoroughly explained by the editor of the printed critical edition (<a href="biblio.html">Bembo 2001</a>, <a href="biblio.html">Vela 1999</a>) the relevance of <a href="https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_zvLQKYoobRoC/mode/2up" target="_blank">P</a> in the history of <i>Prose</i> lies not only in its significance as a document and in the fact that, until the publication of the second edition in 1538, it was the only text available to those authors who were trying to write their literary works in vernacular, but in the importance that Bembo himself gave it. The <i>princeps</i> can be considered as a bridge between a reasoning on the vernacular language that started at the very beginning of the XVI century, with the editions of Petrarca's <i>Le cose volgari</i> and Dante's <i>Terze rime</i> - and, through the elaboration documented by manuscript <a href="https://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Vat.lat.3210" target="_blank">Vat.lat. 3210</a>, brought to P itself - and a further elaboration that culminated in the publication of <a href="https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=q8amtHxSU74C&pg=GBS.PP6&hl=it">T</a> (Torrentino 1549).</p>
            <p>Since the elaboration documented by the text of V - which is near but prior to the text of P - can only be related to the <i>princeps</i>, from which Bembo moves towards M and T, the critical edition by Vela proposes a willingly partial edition, which only takes into account the text of P - chosen as base-text - and compares it with the final reading of V, providing also a genetic apparatus that represents the elaboration within the manuscript itself. The resulting edition combines typographic markers embedded in the base-text (an exhaustive list of which can be found in <a href="biblio.html">Bembo 2001</a>, <i>Il sistema paratestuale ecdotico</i>, pp. LXXXVIII-XCI) <!-- - that allow to immediately identify both variants between V and P and passages resulting from elaboration within V - --> with a three band apparatus, that records: 
                <ol>
                    <li>First band: elaboration within V</li>
                    <li>Second band: variant readings between V and P. A smaller band records paragraphemic variants between the two witnesses</li>
                    <li>Third band: errors listed in the <i>Errori da glimpressori per inavertenza fatti</i> (<i>errata corrige</i>). The copy-text presents the corrected lesson (between superscript "E"), while the original text is recorded in this last band of the apparatus</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>All these levels were encoded in the XML/TEI file through multiple TEI modules, in particular <code>textcrit</code> for variants across witnesses and <code>transcr</code> for the genetic level related to the manuscript, whereas for errors the <code>choice</code> element was selected. More details about the markup choices can be found in the project <a href="documentation.html#variants" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>
            <p>As mentioned, the evolution of the text doesn't stop with the edition published by Tacuino in 1525, but goes on with a second edition, published by Francesco Marcolini in 1538, and a third one, published two years after the death of the author by Lorenzo Torrentino in Florence. In order to gain a comprehensive view of the evolution of Bembo's <i>Prose</i>, M and T were included as well. On account of the previoulsy described relation between V and the editions that follow the <i>princeps</i>, M and T were collated with P for the selected pages. Passages involved in variants from V to P on the paragraphemic level were also compared with M and T, but no further analysis was carried out on formal variants.</p>
            <p>The studies by Sorella and Bertolo, Cursi and Pulsoni have been used as a reference to record stop-press variants which are due to Varchi’s intervention. A detailed discussion of the encoding of stop-press variants can be found in the documentation.</p>
